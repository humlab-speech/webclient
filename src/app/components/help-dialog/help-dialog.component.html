                    You are now running the Jupyter notebook application.
                    Using the emuR library, you can load your Emu-R database and perform various analyses on it.
                    The code you run here is executed on the VISP server and not on your local machine.

<pre>
Write your code in the editor on the right side of the screen.
On your left you will see your project directory.

You need to save your work in order for it to be stored on the VISP server. 
You can go back and forth between the dashboard and the Jupyter session without losing your work.
However, the system will periodically shut down idle sessions, so save your work and don't count on your session being available
the next time you login.
