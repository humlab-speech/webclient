                <h2>What is this?</h2>
                You are now running RStudio with access to your project.
                The code you run here will be executed on the server and you can use this to analyze your data.

                <h2>How to use this tool</h2>
                Write your code in the editor on the left side of the screen.
                On your lower right you will see your project directory.
                
                Don't forget to save your work by clicking the save button before shutting down your RStudio session.
                You can go back to the dashboard by clicking the "Back to dashboard" button on the top right corner of the screen.
                This will not cause you to lose your work since you can rejoin the session later as long as it is still running, however,
                the Visible Speech system will periodically shut down idle sessions to save resources, 
                so please save your work and try not to rely on your session still running when you come back next time.
